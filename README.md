# Top-Gear-Bikes-ERP-implementation

A medium-sized company, Top Gear Motorcycles (TGB) produces and distributes racing bikes. As a result of the company's Legacy technologies, it has remained the same since its founding in 1989. The Directors want to deploy an ERP system because industry needs have evolved significantly, and the company recognizes that its current systems and procedures are inflexible.
It is hoped that the new ERP deployment will address two key flaws in the current systems. It is inevitable that legacy systems cannot produce accurate and timely data. 
Providing a viable ERP system that has a good match with TGB's business objectives and improves the company's competitiveness and growth will be the goal of this Case Study.
